This output is exactly what we need to evaluate the model's performance at a granular level. Let's break down one row as an example and then discuss the overall picture:\n","\n","# Example Row Breakdown (Row 1):\n","\n","2024-08-01 00:00:00: The prediction is for the month of August 2024.\n","\n","3110 - KRIV: This likely represents the Storename (Store 3110, perhaps KRIV is a region or type).\n","\n","KOL BLACK PEPPER GROUND 100G: This is the Item_Name.\n","\n","65429: This is the Item_Code.\n","\n","CGD: This is the Dept_Name.\n","\n","237.9972: This is the Actual_PRICE for this specific item in this store during August 2024 (from your y_test data).\n","\n","262.155: This is the Predicted_PRICE generated by the FLAML model for this item/store/month combination.\n","\n","24.1577...: This is the Prediction_Error (Predicted - Actual). The model predicted about 24 units higher than the actual price.\n","\n","10.1504...: This is the Absolute_Percentage_Error (APE). The prediction was about 10.15% higher than the actual price.\n","\n","# Interpreting the Results Overall:\n","\n","Row-Level Detail: You can now see the specific prediction for each unique combination of Month, Storename, and Item_Name/Item_Code.\n","\n","Performance Varies: Notice how the predictions and errors differ significantly across rows, even within the same store (3110 - KRIV) and month:\n","\n","For KOL BLACK PEPPER GROUND 100G, the prediction was ~10% high.\n","\n","For KOL CARDAMON GROUND 100G, the prediction (262.155) was much lower than the actual (431.997), resulting in a large negative error and a ~39% APE.\n","\n","For KOL CHILIES GROUND 50G, the prediction (209.31) was much higher than the actual (81.00), leading to a very high positive error and a huge 158% APE.\n","\n","For KOL CINNAMON GROUND 100G, the prediction (209.31) was very close to the actual (204.99), resulting in a small error and only ~2% APE.\n","\n","# Model Strengths/Weaknesses: This kind of detailed view helps you identify:\n","\n","Items/Categories Predicted Well: Items like the Cinnamon Ground 100G seem well-predicted (low error).\n","\n","Items/Categories Predicted Poorly: Items like Chilies Ground 50G or Cardamon Ground 100G have large errors. This might indicate the model struggles with these specific items, maybe due to volatile pricing, sparse data for them in the training set, or missing features that drive their price.\n","\n","Systematic Bias? Look for patterns. Does the model consistently over-predict or under-predict for certain departments, brands, or price ranges? (In this small sample, it seems mixed).\n","\n","Actionable Insights: Based on this, you might decide:\n","\n","The model is generally acceptable if the average error across all items is low enough.\n","\n","Specific items/categories need further investigation or maybe even separate modeling approaches.\n","\n","More feature engineering might be needed to capture factors influencing the poorly predicted items.\n","\n","To retrain the model, perhaps excluding certain volatile items or focusing the evaluation metric (e.g., using MAE instead of RMSE if outliers are heavily penalized).\n","\n","In conclusion, this detailed comparison view is crucial. It shows your model is generating predictions at the intended item/store/month level, but its accuracy varies significantly across different items. You now have the information needed to perform a much deeper evaluation of the model's quality.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"59ad3647-8f49-4db1-8ede-60c777cc04c5"}],"metadata":{"kernel_info":{"name":"synapse_pyspark"},"kernelspec":{"name":"synapse_pyspark","language":"Python","display_name":"Synapse PySpark"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"automl_config":{"lakehouseInfo":{"lakehouseName":"model_data","lakehouseId":"ee0b2da1-5ca6-4b9b-8bfb-49e6d3e66ee1","workspaceId":"8d3e063b-5552-4052-b919-22ef780dcf63","state":"ready","errMsg":""},"tableInfo":{"type":"table","tableInfo":{"name":"SPICEdata csv","fullAbfsPath":"abfss://8d3e063b-5552-4052-b919-22ef780dcf63@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/ee0b2da1-5ca6-4b9b-8bfb-49e6d3e66ee1/Tables/dbo/SPICEdata csv","type":"MANAGED","format":"","isDeltaTable":true,"relativePath":"Tables/dbo/SPICEdata csv"},"columns":[{"name":"Year","type":"long","nullable":true},{"name":"Month","type":"date","nullable":true},{"name":"Dept_Name","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Section_Name","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Family_name","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Sub_Family_Name","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Brand_Principle","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Brand_Name","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"SupplierName","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Item_Code","type":"long","nullable":true},{"name":"Item_Bar_Code","type":"long","nullable":true},{"name":"Item_Name","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"BRAND","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"TYPE","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"VARIANTS_2","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"CATEGORY","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"SUPER_CATEGORY","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"PACKAGING","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"PRICE","type":"double","nullable":true},{"name":"Storename","type":"string","nullable":true},{"name":"Qty","type":"double","nullable":true}],"schemaName":"dbo"},"trainData":{"predictColumn":"PRICE","enableFeaturization":true,"mappingColumns":[{"name":"Year","type":"long","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Month","type":"date","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Dept_Name","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Section_Name","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Family_name","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Sub_Family_Name","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Brand_Principle","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Brand_Name","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"SupplierName","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Item_Code","type":"long","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Item_Bar_Code","type":"long","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Item_Name","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"BRAND","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"TYPE","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"VARIANTS_2","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"CATEGORY","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"SUPER_CATEGORY","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"PACKAGING","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"PRICE","type":"double","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Storename","type":"string","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"},{"name":"Qty","type":"double","nullable":true,"valueType":"Auto","imputationMethod":"Auto"}],"timeColumn":"Month","horizon":5,"frequency":"Quarter"},"mlModel":{"task":"Forecasting","mode":"QuickProto","duration":"-1","metric":"","endEarly":false},"finalDetails":{"parallelizationMethod":"trainMultiple","notebookName":"AutoML Notebook -
