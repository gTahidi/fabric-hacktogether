Video Demo Guidance Script for Microsoft Fabric Hackathon Proposal: Retail Sales Prediction

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------
• Greet the audience:
  “Hello, my name is [Your Name] from Ujao AI. Welcome to our demo for the Microsoft Fabric Hackathon.”

• Briefly introduce the project:
  “Our project aims to predict retail sales using a robust analytics platform built on Microsoft Fabric. The solution leverages the Medallion architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to ingest, clean, transform, and model sales data to provide accurate demand forecasts.”

------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW (Based on README.md)
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Abstract/Summary:
   - Highlight the focus on retail sales prediction.
   - Emphasize the integration of data ingestion, transformation, and modeling using Microsoft Fabric components.
   
2. Problem Statement:
   - Explain the common challenges faced by local retailers, like stockouts or overstocking.
   - Describe how our solution addresses these challenges by providing precise forecasting.
   
3. The Solution:
   - Data Ingestion and Processing: Using Dataflows Gen2, Notebooks (PySpark) to transform raw data.
   - Modeling: Utilization of time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, multiple regression) with MLflow for tracking.
   - Visualization: Interactive dashboards in Power BI for clear presentation of forecasts and insights.
   
4. Architecture Overview:
   - Briefly explain the Medallion architecture:
     • Bronze – Raw data ingestion.
     • Silver – Data cleansing and transformation.
     • Gold – Aggregated data used for analytics and modeling.
   - Mention that detailed notebooks (e.g., Spice_Test.ipynb, Automl.ipynb) demonstrate each phase.
