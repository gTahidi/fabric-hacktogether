# Proposal for RustDesk Installation, Configuration, and Training

## Introduction
We propose to implement RustDesk on your infrastructure to enable secure, reliable remote access. This project includes a full installation, system tuning for optimized performance, and detailed user training. The implementation will be designed for a Linux/Windows hybrid environment with high availability, and we will conduct an initial infrastructure assessment to tailor the configuration to your network topology and security policies.

| Log Dumping to AWS S3            | Configure automatic log dumping to AWS S3; set up log rotation, archival policies, and access monitoring.                                      | 2 hours        |
| User Training                    | Conduct a hands-on training session for 4 participants with detailed manuals, cheat sheets, and Q&A session.                                   | 6 hours        |
| Post-Deployment Support          | Provide 30 days of support with troubleshooting sessions, feedback integration, and minor enhancements.                                        | 10 hours       |

## Timeline

| Day(s)        | Activities                                                                                                                                                                                          | Estimated Time |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Day 1         | Initial consultation, infrastructure assessment, requirements gathering; pre-deployment planning including risk assessment and contingency setup.                                               | 3 hours        |
| Day 2-3       | Installation and initial configuration of RustDesk with environment-specific customizations; in-depth verification, load tests, and security validations.                                        | 6 hours        |
| Day 4         | Detailed interactive training covering system usage, security protocols, best practices; handover of comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guidelines.                        | 6 hours        |
| Day 5-6       | Integration with Odoo projects including API testing and data synchronization; setup and testing of log dumping to AWS S3 including secure access and backup verification.                | 6 hours        |
| Day 7-30      | Continuous post-deployment support with scheduled check-ins, performance reviews, and addressing feedback to ensure system stability.                                                            | 10 hours       |

## Assumptions and Risks
- Client will provide timely access to necessary infrastructure and credentials.
- Network configurations and firewall restrictions may require additional time if unexpected.
- Delays in third-party integrations (e.g., Odoo, AWS) may impact timeline.
- Hardware and network compatibility will be verified during the initial assessment.
