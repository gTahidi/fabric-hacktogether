# Microsoft Fabric Hackathon Proposal: Retail Sales Prediction

**Team/Submitter:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Date:** 2025-04-01

## 1. Abstract/Summary

This project proposes the development of a sales prediction solution for a local retailer using Microsoft Fabric. By implementing a Medallion architecture, we will ingest, clean, transform, and model historical sales data to generate accurate future sales forecasts. This will empower the retailer with data-driven insights for improved inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business strategy.

## 2. Problem Statement

Local retailers struggle with accurate sales forecasting, leading to potential operational inefficiencies like stockouts or overstocking. This project addresses the need for a reliable prediction system by analyzing historical sales patterns for various goods sold by the retailer. The primary goal is to predict sales volume for specific future periods (e.g., weekly, monthly).

## 3. Proposed Solution

We propose leveraging Microsoft Fabric to build an end-to-end analytics solution:
*   **Data Ingestion:** Utilize Fabric Data Factory or Dataflows to ingest raw sales data.
*   **Data Processing:** Implement a Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) within a Fabric Lakehouse/Warehouse using Notebooks (Spark) and/or Dataflows for cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
*   **Modeling:** Develop sales forecasting models (potentially starting with time series analysis within Fabric Notebooks).
*   **Visualization:** Use Power BI connected to the Gold layer to present forecasts and insights.

## 4. Architecture Overview

The solution follows the Medallion architecture:
*   **Bronze:** Raw data storage in OneLake.
*   **Silver:** Cleaned, conformed data stored as Delta tables in the Lakehouse.
*   **Gold:** Aggregated, analysis-ready data (features for modeling, reporting views) stored in the Lakehouse or Warehouse.

*(Refer to the Medallion Architecture diagram in README.md)*

## 5. Implementation Plan (High-Level)

1.  Set up Fabric workspace and necessary components (Lakehouse, etc.).
2.  Develop ingestion pipelines for raw sales data (Bronze).
3.  Implement cleaning and transformation logic (Bronze -> Silver).
4.  Develop aggregation and feature engineering logic (Silver -> Gold).
5.  Build and train initial forecasting models using Gold layer data.
6.  Develop Power BI reports for visualization.
7.  Document the process and findings.

## 6. Technology Stack

*   **Primary:** Microsoft Fabric (OneLake, Lakehouse, Warehouse, Data Factory, Notebooks, Power BI)
*   **Languages:** PySpark, Spark SQL, Python
*   **Potential Integration:** Azure AI / Azure Machine Learning (for advanced modeling if required)

## 7. Expected Outcomes & Benefits

*   An automated pipeline for processing sales data within Fabric.
*   Accurate sales forecasts for different products/categories.
*   Actionable insights via Power BI dashboards.
*   Improved inventory management and reduced waste/stockouts for the retailer.
*   Demonstration of Microsoft Fabric's capabilities for end-to-end analytics solutions.
