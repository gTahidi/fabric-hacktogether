# Microsoft Fabric Hackathon Proposal: Retail Sales Prediction

**Team/Submitter:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Date:** 2025-04-01

## 1. Abstract/Summary

This project proposes the development of a sales prediction solution for a local retailer leveraging the unified analytics capabilities of Microsoft Fabric. By implementing a Medallion architecture, we will ingest, clean, transform, and model historical sales data to generate accurate future sales forecasts. This solution aims to empower the retailer with data-driven insights for improved inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business strategy, ultimately driving efficiency and profitability.

## 2. Problem Statement

Local retailers often struggle with accurate sales forecasting due to complex factors like seasonality, promotions, and economic shifts. These inaccuracies lead to significant operational inefficiencies, including costly stockouts (lost sales) or overstocking (increased holding costs and waste). This project addresses the critical need for a reliable prediction system by analyzing historical sales patterns for various goods. The primary goal is to predict sales volume for specific future periods (e.g., weekly, monthly), enabling proactive decision-making.

## 3. Proposed Solution

We propose leveraging Microsoft Fabric to build an end-to-end analytics solution:
*   **Data Ingestion:** Utilize Fabric Data Factory or Dataflows to ingest raw sales data.
*   **Data Processing:** Implement a Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) within a Fabric Lakehouse/Warehouse using Notebooks (PySpark/Spark SQL) and/or Dataflows Gen2 for robust cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
*   **Modeling:** Develop and train time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) using the curated Gold layer data within Fabric Notebooks. Utilize MLflow integrated within Fabric for experiment tracking and model management.
*   **Visualization:** Use Power BI connected seamlessly to the Gold layer (Lakehouse/Warehouse) to present forecasts, model performance, and key business insights through interactive dashboards.

## 4. Architecture Overview

The solution follows the Medallion architecture:
*   **Bronze:** Raw data storage in OneLake.
*   **Silver:** Cleaned, conformed data stored as Delta tables in the Lakehouse.
*   **Gold:** Aggregated, analysis-ready data (features for modeling, reporting views) stored in the Lakehouse or Warehouse.

*(Refer to the Medallion Architecture diagram in README.md)*

## 5. Implementation Plan (High-Level)

1.  Set up Fabric workspace and necessary components (Lakehouse, etc.).
2.  Develop ingestion pipelines for raw sales data (Bronze).
3.  Implement cleaning and transformation logic (Bronze -> Silver).
4.  Develop aggregation and feature engineering logic (Silver -> Gold).
5.  Build, train, and evaluate initial forecasting models using Gold layer data within Fabric Notebooks.
6.  Refine models based on evaluation metrics and potentially incorporate additional features.
7.  Develop Power BI reports and dashboards for visualization.
8.  Document the end-to-end process, architecture, and findings.

## 6. Technology Stack

*   **Core Platform:** Microsoft Fabric, leveraging its unified components: OneLake, Lakehouse, Warehouse, Data Factory, Dataflows Gen2, Notebooks (Spark), MLflow integration, and Power BI.
*   **Languages:** PySpark, Spark SQL, Python (for data manipulation and modeling).
*   **Potential Extension:** Azure AI / Azure Machine Learning (for deploying models as endpoints or using specialized AI services if needed beyond the hackathon scope).

## 7. Expected Outcomes & Benefits

*   An automated, end-to-end pipeline for processing sales data within the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem.
*   Reliable sales forecasts for key products/categories, enabling better planning.
*   Actionable insights delivered through interactive Power BI dashboards.
*   Potential for improved inventory management, leading to reduced waste and fewer stockouts for the retailer.
*   A clear demonstration of Fabric's integrated capabilities, including data engineering, data science (with MLflow), and business intelligence within a single platform.
*   Showcase of the Medallion architecture implementation within Fabric for data quality and governance.
